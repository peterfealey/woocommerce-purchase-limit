# woocommerce-purchase-limit

Currently limits one purchase per customer based on email address, and a max quantity of 4 items in that first purchase for products with the category 'limited-tickets'.

Pull requests welcome to include a UI that allows user to select which category they want to limit, and to select the qty allowed for purchase - I'm not much of a Wordpress plugin dev.
